# Name: Extrapolate-EP3-DLPNO
#
# *************************************** DESCRIPTION ***********************************************
#
#   This protocol estimates the complete basis limit (CBS) extrapolated electronic energy. It is an  
# approximation to the CCSD(T)/CBS electronic energy. It uses two different methods to calculate the
# correlation energy. One method is 'cheaper', in this case DLPNO-CCSD(T), and then also the canonical
# CCSD(T)
#   The idea is that one can calculate the difference between the canonical CCSD(T) and  DLPNO-CCSD(T)
# method with a small basis set, for which one can afford the canonical CCSD(T) method. Then 
# calculate the extrapolated DLPNO-CCSD(T) energy and use the small basis set correction.
#   There is a difference between the EP3 family of extrapolations and the EP2 one. In the EP2 scheme
# one uses the expensive CCSD(T) energy with a small basis set X and then uses the X and X+1 basis sets
# to extrapolate the chep method. In EP3 one needs to perform 3 calculations with the cheaper method, one
# using the X basis set to evaluate the difference between CCSD(T) and method M and two more for method
# M with basis sets X+1 and X+2
#   The EP3 scheme is of course more expensive than the corresponding EP2. Nevertheless still in EP3
# the time defining step is the evaluation of the canonical CCSD(T). It has also been shown (J. Phys.
# Chem. A 2012, 116, 19, 4801-4816) that it is more accurate than the EP2 schemes.#

# ***************************************   DETAILS   ************************************************
#
# This scheme needs 3 steps:
# In Step 1 We perform a CCSD(T) calculation with a basis set X (in the current case we have
#           chosen cc-pVDZ).
# In Step 2 We perform a DLPNO-CCSD(T1) calculation again with the small basis set X
# In Step 3 We perform an DLPNO-CCSD(T1) calculation with a basis set Y that has a cardinal larger than
#           the basis set X by 1 (in the current case we have chosen cc-pVTZ).
# In Step 4 We perform an DLPNO-CCSD(T1) calculation with a basis set Z that has a cardinal larger than
#           the basis set X by 2 (in the current case we have chosen cc-pVQZ).
# 
# From calculations of Step 1 and Step 2 we get the correlation energy and calculate the correction to
#   the correlation energy with basis X as:
#                Correction =CCSDT_X - DLPNO_X
# From calculations in Step 3 and Step 4 we get the Hartree-Fock energy and calculate the 
#   SCF extrapolated energy (CBS_SCF) using the two point extrapolation equation:  
#                   SCF(X) = SCF(CBS)+Aexp(-a*SQRT(X))
# Again From calculations in Step 3 and Step 4 we get the correlation energy and calculate 
#   the CBS extrapolated DLPNO_CCSD(T1) correlation energy (CBS_DLPNO) using the two point extrapolation
#   equation:
#             CBS(DLPNO)=(Y^b*E_Y(DLPNO-CCSD(T1))-Z^b*E_Z(DLPNO-CCSD(T1)))/(Y^b-Z^b):
# And thus the extrapolation energy:
#          CBS Total = CBS_SCF + CBS_DLPNO + Correction
#
# ******************************************   NOTES   ************************************************
# NOTE 1: The basis sets chosen can of course change. Nevertheless one should always take care to adjust
#          all of them appropriately and then to also adjust the values of alpha and beta.
# NOTE 2: By default for  the triples part we use the (T1) correction which is more accurate
# NOTE 1: In this case we use the default DLPNO-CCSD(T1) thresholds. Of course one can use TightPNO or 
#         LoosePNO for more accurate or more efficient calculations respectively. Nothing more needs 
#         to change other than adding the corresponding keyword in the orca inputs of steps 2, 3 and 4.#
